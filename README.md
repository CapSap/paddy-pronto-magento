# Automating pronto selling and putting comment in magento

## Goal

2 parts:

- sell the order in pronto
- put the pronto receipt number as a comment in magento

### Challenge

- How do we tell tell the script which orders to sell?
  - give it a csv of all status 30 orders?
  - just let it go by it'self? (don't need to feed it a csv?)
    - okay so how would it be aware of what it needs to do (how many times it needs to sell?)

### Imagined workflow

1. login to mag and pronto web
2. get to the right place in pronto
3.
